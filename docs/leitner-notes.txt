The first tested algorithm was a direct implementation of Leitner method:

1. Prepare set of questions that need repetition (Set0):

   * Explore all questions and move to Set0 all those questions whose
     scheduled time is <= Today or are in box 0

2. Start exercise:

   * Shuffle Set0 (random ordering).
   * While questions in Set0:
       * For iQ=1 until iQ=num questions in Set0
           * Take question iQ and ask it
           * If Success mark it to be promoted, and schedule it for
             repetition at Current date plus Interval Repetition for
             the box in which the question is classified. Else, if
             answer was wrong, move question to box 0.
       * End of For loop

       * At this point a full round of scheduled questions has taken
         place: Remove from Set0 all questions marked as 'to be
         promoted'.

   * End of While loop

 3. At this point, a successful round of all questions has been
    made:

   * Display message informing about exercise completion for today
     and about next repetition schedule. If student would like to
     continue practising must move to 'Practising Mode'.
