Start exercise:
	
   * set RT = 5
   
   * set Maxshows = 200
   
   * set Totalshows = 0
   
   * while (Set0 < 10 cards) add a card.

   * While questions in Set0:
       * For iQ=1 until iQ=num questions in Set0
       	   * If new card, show card & answer until student says "next" then shove card back into set +3 then loop to next card       	   
           * Take question iQ and ask it
           * If Success, increment the question repetitions counter.
             Else reset the question repetitions counter and move
             question to previous box
           * If the question repetitions counter is greater than the
             Repetition Threshold (RT) mark the question to be promoted,
             and schedule it for repetition at Current date plus
             Interval Repetition for the box in which the question
             is classified.
           * totalshows ++
       * End of For loop

       * At this point a full round of scheduled questions has taken
         place: Remove from Set0 all questions marked as 'to be
         promoted'.
         
        * while (Set0.size * RT < (MaxShows - Totalshows)) add a card.
        
        * if Set0.size < 3 break loop
        
        * shuffle cards, making sure new 1st card is not old last card 
         
   * End of While loop

 3. At this point, a successful round of all questions has been
    made:

   * Display message informing about exercise completion for today
     and about next repetition schedule. If student would like to
     continue practising must move to 'Practising Mode'.
