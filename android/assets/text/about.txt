This software incorporates a heavily modified Leitner Learning Method algorithm based on the description of the Leitner system as implemented by LenMus. This software does NOT use any LenMus code or derived code.

The "box" timings are based on information as listed as part of the LenMus project at http://lenmus.sourceforge.net/en/lenmusdocs/hacking/exercises/problem-modes.html that were in Section 1.1.2.3. Repetition intervals.

The card positions during a session are based on using the Pimsleur power of 5 timing intervals accounting for correct or incorrect responses.

SPECIAL NOTES:

The CED chart shows "geji-" for "They + you one" but shows "geja-" on pg 270 as part of a sample c-stem conjugation which matches the Cook dissertation.
