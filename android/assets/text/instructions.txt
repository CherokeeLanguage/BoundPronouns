Each challenge is accompanied by an approximate pronunciation using a synthetic voice. You can tap "Speak" to have the voice repeat.

The audio files in this program were generated by espeak-ng (https://github.com/espeak-ng), which recently had basic Cherokee language support added.

If you don't like the synthetic voice you can tap MUTE.
 
Pronunciation and Markings:

Cherokee has six main vowels. They are “a”, “e”, “i”, “o”, “u”, and “v”.

They are generally pronounced as follows:
• a: as (a) in father.
• e: as (a) in cake.
• i: as (e) in Pete.
• o: as (o) in hello.
• u: as (u) in tuba.
• v: as (u) in rung and is always nasalized.

A long vowel is a vowel held for a normal length of time.
A short vowel is a vowel spoken for a very brief length of time.

Any vowel at the end of a word is short.
Any vowel followed by a consonent with a silent vowel is short.
Any vowel marked with an “underdot” is short.

Any Syllabary letter marked with an "underdot" has a short vowel.
Any Syllabary letter marked with an "under-x" has a silent vowel.

Getting the silent, short, and long vowels correct is very important!

ɂ - A glottal stop indicates a brief pause in speaking. Glottal stops are important!

The superscripted numbers ¹, ², ³, and ⁴ refer to tone. The tones used in words or phrases can dramatically change their meaning.

• A “²” indicates a tone with a normal pitch.
• A “³” indicates a tone with a higher pitch.

Many words have parts with “gliding” tones.

• A “²³” indicates a tone that starts out normal and then is glided somewhat higher.
• A “³²” indicates a tone that starts out somewhat higher and then is glided down to normal.

These tones are the hardest for English speakers to hear. With practice you should be able to pick these out in the accompanying audio.

There are two more tones which will be only marked with single numbers and one special gliding tone that has no marking at all:

• A “¹” indicates a tone that starts normal and then is glided downwards.
• A “⁴” indicates a tone that starts out “normal” or “high” and then is glided upwards. The accompanying audio starts out high then glides upwards.
• At the end of every word, unless marked otherwise, there is a “⁴³” gliding tone which starts out with very high and then is glided down. 

Unlike English, where you stress different syllables in words with loudness you should try and keep all the syllables in your Cherokee words held at an equal volume.

Cherokee is spoken with the tip of the tongue against the lower front teeth most of the time. You should be using the middle of your tongue to make the “s”, “d”, and “t” sounds, not the tongue's tip.

Cherokee does not usually make a distinction between “he”, “she”, or “it”. When you see “he”, you can usually substitute “she” or “it”.
